# Path-Finder-Algo

I have developed an innovative path-finding algorithm. This algorithm operates within a grid map, where users play an active role in setting up the scenario for path finding. Users begin by identifying the start and end points on the grid, essentially marking the journey's origin and destination. 

Furthermore, the algorithm offers the unique capability for users to manually input any blockages or obstacles within the grid. These blockages represent real-world impediments, such as walls or barriers, and challenge the algorithm to find a path that circumvents these obstacles.

Once the parameters are set, the algorithm processes the data to calculate the shortest and most efficient path from the start to the end point, considering all the blockages inputted.
